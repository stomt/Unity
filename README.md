This Widget allows the easy integration of the feedback solution [www.stomt.com](https://www.stomt.com/) in your Unity apps and games. Of course you can find the STOMT feedback widget for Unity3D in the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64669).

## Installation

1. Register as normal user on [www.stomt.com](https://www.stomt.com/) 
2. [Create a target page on STOMT](https://www.stomt.com/createTarget).
3. Go to [Settings > My Apps](https://www.stomt.com/dev/my-apps) and create an application.
4. Download this repository and [or get it from the AssetStore](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/64669) and copy the assets into your project.
5. Add the ```StomtPopup``` prefab to your main UI canvas.
6. Enter all necessary data into the ```StomtAPI``` component on the prefab.     
6.1 Enter the ```Rest Server Url```: rest.stomt.com (Or use our Sandbox for testing - See below)     
6.2 Enter the ```AppId``` you obtained in the third step     
6.3 Enter your ```page username (as Target Id)``` (you find it in your profile-url. E.g. stomt.com/stomt => stomt)     
7. Finished! *Regularly communicate your page on social channels and checkout our [Website-Widget](https://www.stomt.com/dev/js-sdk) for your websites to collect feedback from anywhere.*

## Common Issues

* Error (500) Internal Server Error: [Report] (https://www.stomt.com/dev/unity-sdk) us the problem.
* Target Name doesn't fit: you can easily adjust the width.
